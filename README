# Clothing Store Management System

A clothing store management system that allows employees to manage the inventory and billing.

## Requirements

- Docker
- Node.js


To run the inventory management system that we have created as a Docker container on a fresh installation of Debian 11, you will need to install Docker and Docker Compose on your system.

First, update the package index and install the necessary packages by running the following commands:


sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg-agent software-properties-common

Next, add the Docker GPG key and repository to your system by running the following commands:


curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
Update the package index again and install Docker and Docker Compose by running the following commands:


sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
sudo apt install -y docker-compose
