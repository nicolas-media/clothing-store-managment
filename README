# Clothing Store

A clothing store application built with Node.js, React, and MongoDB.

## Features

- Barcode scanning for adding items to the cart
- Stock management for adding and removing items from the stock
- User management for creating and logging in as users

## Requirements

- Docker
- Docker Compose

To run the inventory management system that we have created as a Docker container on a fresh installation of Debian 11, you will need to install Docker and Docker Compose on your system.

First, update the package index and install the necessary packages by running the following commands:


sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg-agent software-properties-common

Next, add the Docker GPG key and repository to your system by running the following commands:


curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
Update the package index again and install Docker and Docker Compose by running the following commands:


sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y docker-ce docker-c

## Running the Application

git clone https://github.com/nicolas-media/clothing-store-managment.git

2. Navigate to the directory:

cd clothing-store-managment

3. Build the Docker image:
